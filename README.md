# ToDo-List-MERN

## OVERVIEW

1. This is a minimalistic and concise to-do list web app built using MERN Stack.
2. The web app allows the user to perform all high-level CRUD operations i.e., Creating, UploadEditing, Deleting, and Retrieving the tasks.
3. All the data is completely dynamic and no constants are used throughout the app.
4. Material UI is used for UI management to enhance the overall application apart from native CSS styling.

## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1. The front-end application is deployed on vercel which can be accessed from this link **https://task-manager-mern-nine.vercel.app** or else it can be accessed from the repo home page.
2. If the user is willing to run the development server, clone the repo locally and follow the below steps.
3. The project folder consists of two folders **client** and **server**. The client consists of React code, whereas the server consists of Node.js, Express, and Mongo connection codes.
4. To start the frontend server, enter cd client and run npm i install the necessary dependencies. Once installed run npm start and this will start the development server on localhost:3000.
5. A similar procedure should be followed to start the backend server as well. To make sure the connection is established, look out for port and Mongo connection log statements in the terminal. Once both are running simultaneously, the app can be tested to and fro.
